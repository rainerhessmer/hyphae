# hyphae

Port of Anders Hoff's Python based implementation of [hyphae](http://inconvergent.net/generative/hyphae/) to JavaScript and OpenProcessing.

Big thanks to Anders Hoff for sharing the code behind his generative art and for the associated [write-ups](http://inconvergent.net/generative/).

## Web
Live link: [hyphaeZones.html](http://hessmer.org/generative/Hyphae/hyphaeZones.html)

## Processing
The code resides in the Processing subfolder. The output is drawn on a hidden, high resolution graphics context but is periodically downsampled and displayed so that the progress can be observed while the program is running.

Press 'p' to pause the execution; press ' ' (spacebar) to save the high resolution output as a png file.  

## Sample Output
